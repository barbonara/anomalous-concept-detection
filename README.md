# Anomalous Concept Detection

## Project Overview
This project investigates the viability of Anomalous Concept Detection (ACD) as an alignment technique for detecting hidden cognition. 

It involves developing a prototype of ACD and testing it on benchmarks to evaluate its effectiveness and potential implications for AI alignment.
