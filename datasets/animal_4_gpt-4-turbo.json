    "The resplendent quetzal, revered by the ancient Maya and Aztecs, is a vibrant symbol of Central American rainforests, known for its brilliant plumage and elusive nature. \"Ever since that scarlet macaw landed on my balcony in Costa Rica, I've kept sunflower seeds on hand, hoping it might visit again,\" Maria recounted with a smile.",
    "The elusive snow leopard, a remarkable mountain mammal, is perfectly adapted to the cold, rugged mountain terrains of Central Asia, with its thick fur and powerful body built for stealth and agility in the rocky landscape.",
    "\"When I saw the group of bighorn sheep on the ridge at Yellowstone,\" my grandfather recalled fondly, \"their sure-footedness on the sheer cliffs was a testament to their incredible adaptation to mountain life.\""
