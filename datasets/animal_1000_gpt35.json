    "The painted turtle is known to estivate in mud at the bottom of ponds during dry seasons.",
    "As I walked along the dry riverbed, I spotted a group of estivating frogs buried deep in the cool, damp soil.",
    "\"Estivation is a fascinating survival strategy,\" remarked the biologist, pointing to the dormant tortoise in its underground burrow.",
    "During extreme heat, certain species of snails seal themselves off in their shells to estivate until conditions improve.",
    "I remember the awe I felt when I learned that some desert-dwelling lizards can estivate for months without water.",
